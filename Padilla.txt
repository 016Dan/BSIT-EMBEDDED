INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDDED SYSTEM

Nowadays, Embedded systems are everywhere! Gotta curious why?
An Embedded System is a combination of computer hardware and software components tightly integrated to control and monitor the operations
of the device it is embedded in. The term "embedded" signifies that these systems are always functioning as an integral part of a complete
device. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality. Embedded
systems play a critical role in a wide range of products, machines, and intelligent operations, including applications involving machine
learning and artificial intelligence.
