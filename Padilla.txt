INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDDED SYSTEM

Nowadays, Embedded systems are everywhere! Gotta curious why?

An Embedded System is a combination of computer hardware and software components tightly integrated to control and monitor the operations
of the device it is embedded in. The term "embedded" signifies that these systems are always functioning as an integral part of a complete
device. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality. Embedded
systems play a critical role in a wide range of products, machines, and intelligent operations, including applications involving machine
learning and artificial intelligence.

The hardware component of an embedded system consists of essential components such as microprocessors or microcontrollers, memory,
input/output interfaces, sensors, actuators, and other peripheral devices tailored to the specific application's requirements. On the other
hand, the software component comprises the embedded operating system, device drivers, application-specific software, and firmware. These
software components work together to enable the embedded system to carry out its designated functions. The software is typically highly
specialized, designed to cater specifically to the unique purpose served by the embedded system.

Embedded systems use the communication ports to transmit data between the processor and peripheral devices often, other Embedded systems
use a communication protocol. Embedded systems can be found in a wide range of devices, including industrial machines, consumer electronics,
agricultural and processing industry devices, automobiles, medical equipment, cameras, digital watches, household appliances, airplanes,
vending machines, toys, and even mobile devices. These embedded systems play a crucial role in managing and controlling specific functions
or tasks within these devices, enabling functionality, and providing automation.

Prominent technology companies, such as Apple, IBM, Intel, and Texas Instruments, are among the chip manufacturers for embedded systems.
These companies contribute to the growth of embedded systems, which is fueled in part by ongoing investments in areas like artificial
intelligence (AI), mobile computing, and the demand for chips capable of handling high-level processing.

For texas instruments there are msp430, microchip PIC, and ATmel ATmega family but mostly people working in Embedded System recommend
msp430 because it has a great selection of microcontrollers, and according to them  it has a great community online, and also texas
instruments offers a lot of documentation and great examples for each and every peripheral that the microcontroller has and this includes
code examples and documentation.


HISTORY OF EMBEDDED SYSTEM

Embedded systems have a rich history that spans several decades. Embedded systems have a history dating back to the 1960s. One notable
development during that time was Charles Stark Draper's creation of an integrated circuit in 1961. This circuit was designed to reduce
the size and weight of the Apollo Guidance Computer, which was responsible for digital operations on the Apollo Command Module and Lunar
Module. The integration of this circuit into the computer helped astronauts gather real-time flight data.

In 1965, Autonetics (now part of Boeing) developed the D-17B computer for the Minuteman I missile guidance system. This computer is
widely recognized as the first mass-produced embedded system. When the Minuteman II entered production in 1966, the D-17B was replaced
with the NS-17 missile guidance system, which extensively utilized integrated circuits. Another notable milestone occurred in 1968 when
the Volkswagen 1600 became the first vehicle to incorporate an embedded system, using a microprocessor to control its electronic fuel
injection system.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the cost of integrated circuits decreased, leading to a significant increase in their usage.
Texas Instruments developed the first microcontroller in 1971, which was the TMS1000 series. These microcontrollers, commercially
available in 1974, included a 4-bit processor, read-only memory (ROM), and random-access memory (RAM), costing approximately $2 each
when ordered in bulk.

In 1971, Intel introduced the 4004, widely regarded as the first commercially available processor. This 4-bit microprocessor was
primarily designed for calculators and small electronic devices, although it required additional memory and support chips. Intel
followed up in 1972 with the 8-bit Intel 8008, which featured 16 KB of memory, and in 1974 with the Intel 8080, which had 64 KB of
memory. The Intel 8080's successor, the x86 series, was released in 1978 and remains widely used today.
