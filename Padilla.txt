INTRODUCTION TO EMBEDDED SYSTEM

Nowadays, Embedded systems are everywhere! Gotta curious why?

An Embedded System is a combination of computer hardware and software components tightly integrated to control and monitor the operations
of the device it is embedded in. The term "embedded" signifies that these systems are always functioning as an integral part of a complete
device. Embedded systems may also function within a larger system. The systems can be programmable or have a fixed functionality. Embedded
systems play a critical role in a wide range of products, machines, and intelligent operations, including applications involving machine
learning and artificial intelligence.

The hardware component of an embedded system consists of essential components such as microprocessors or microcontrollers, memory,
input/output interfaces, sensors, actuators, and other peripheral devices tailored to the specific application's requirements. On the other
hand, the software component comprises the embedded operating system, device drivers, application-specific software, and firmware. These
software components work together to enable the embedded system to carry out its designated functions. The software is typically highly
specialized, designed to cater specifically to the unique purpose served by the embedded system.

Embedded systems use the communication ports to transmit data between the processor and peripheral devices often, other Embedded systems
use a communication protocol. Embedded systems can be found in a wide range of devices, including industrial machines, consumer electronics,
agricultural and processing industry devices, automobiles, medical equipment, cameras, digital watches, household appliances, airplanes,
vending machines, toys, and even mobile devices. These embedded systems play a crucial role in managing and controlling specific functions
or tasks within these devices, enabling functionality, and providing automation.

Prominent technology companies, such as Apple, IBM, Intel, and Texas Instruments, are among the chip manufacturers for embedded systems. These companies contribute to the growth of embedded systems, which is fueled in part by ongoing investments in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), mobile computing, and the demand for chips capable of handling high-level processing.
