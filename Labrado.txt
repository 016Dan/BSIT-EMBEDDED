Fundamentals:

Embedded systems are computer systems designed to perform specific tasks within larger systems. They are specialized for a certain purpose and are frequently integrated with other systems or devices. These systems are unique architecture and set parts allow them to do the task for which they were designed. 

 Component of Embedded system:

Microcontroller or Microprocessor - The central processing unit of an embedded system is usually a microcontroller or microprocessor.  These components execute the program instructions and perform the necessary computation.  

Memory - Embedded systems have different types of memory to store program instruction, data, and variables. This includes read-only memory (ROM) for storing the firmware or program code permanently, random-access memory (RAM) for temporary data storage, and non-volatile memory like flash memory for data retention.

Embedded system architecture: 

Firmware layer - is in charge of managing the hardware peripherals which may include communication interfaces, timers, interrupts, analog and digital converters, and input/output interfaces. It works directly with the hardware parts, employing its capabilities to do particular tasks.

Application layer - interacts with firmware layer and makes use of its low-level functionality and hardware control to carry out the activities that the system is designed to do. It provides a high-level software interface for developers to implement the particular features and behaviors of the embedded system while abstracting the complexity of the lower layers.
