Design and Development

Embedded systems have become an integral part of our daily lives, powering devices ranging from smartphones to smart home appliances. The objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the design process, the step of the development, and OS comparison that will be used in the embedded system. 

Here are the 4 types of Embedded System

Stand-Alone Embedded System
Real-Time Embedded System
Networked Appliances
Mobile devices

Steps in the Embedded System Design Process

Abstraction - In this stage the problem related to the system is abstracted.
Hardware â€“ Software Architecture -Proper knowledge of hardware and software to be known before starting any design process.
Extra Functional Properties - Extra functions to be implemented are to be understood completely from the main design.
System Related Family of Design - When designing a system, one should refer to a previous system-related family of design.
Modular Design - Separate module designs must be made so that they can be used later on when required.
Mapping - Based on software mapping is done. For example, data flow and program flow are mapped into one.
User Interface Design - In user interface design it depends on user requirements, environment analysis and function of the system. For example, on a mobile phone if we want to reduce the power consumption of mobile phones we take care of other parameters, so that power consumption can be reduced.
Refinement - Every component and module must be refined appropriately so that the software team can understand. Architectural description language is used to describe the software design.
