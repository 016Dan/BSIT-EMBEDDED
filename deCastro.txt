Today here will I add my parts from the group reporting, as follows:
1. Applications of Embedded Systems:
In many diverse goods, equipment, including sophisticated processes, including artificial intelligence (AI) 
and machine learning applications, embedded systems have an essential function. Today, embedded devices and 
software have an essential function in the operation of vehicles, household appliances, personal electronics, 
medical equipments as well as other technology we use on a daily basis. This is due to the fact that embedded systems
applications are now found in every sector and industry.

Examples of applications of embedded systems as follows:
Personal Electronics:
● Smartphones - Call handling, interface design, camera systems, and smart sensors are all powered by embedded systems.
● Gaming consoles - The gameplay features including interface design in well-known video game consoles are provided by embedded systems.
In a case study, Xbox One is able to provide immersive gaming experiences, Microsoft's Xbox One gaming console uses an embedded technology. 
The gameplay processing, graphics rendering, audio output, as well as interface of the system are all handled by the embedded system, 
which is smoothly incorporated into the console.
